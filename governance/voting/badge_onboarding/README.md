## Badge Onboarding 

If you think you should be a badge holder within the Radicle Grants Org (RGO), this is the page for you.

> Note: all the details below assume we are on the Optimism Network, which OtterSpace is using prior to moving to Ethereum Mainnet. 

### Grantee Badge 
If you are a recipient of grant funding from the RGO, follow these steps:
* Go to the [Grantee Badge page](https://beta.otterspace.xyz/communities/75)
* Click on _mint badge_ to mint your badge

### Team Member Badge

If you are a member of the [Radicle Grants Org (RGO) Multi-Sig](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x394B920c5d39E0Ca40fCa2871569B6B90D750c7c/transactions/history), please do the following:
* Go to the [Team Member Badge page](https://beta.otterspace.xyz/communities/75)
* Click on _mint badge_ to mint your badge

### Debugging 

If you do not see _mint badge_, this is likely for 2 reasons:
1. You're not on the Optimism Network. If this is the case, please switch networks. [See instructions here for Metamask](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/6223777057179-How-do-I-use-Optimism-with-MetaMask-).
2. You're on the Optimism Network, but your Optimism Network based wallet address has not been added to the mint list. Please reach out to Bordumb (bordumb#6773 on Discord or bordumbb@gmail.com) to get added. **If you are a Grantee**, provide a link to your successful grant application and/or grant funding transaction on Etherscan.

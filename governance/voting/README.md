# Voting

These are notes describing our process for voting on (and thus funding) projects. 

> Note: this space is meant to help with the transition to token-based voting, as outlined in the [Temperature Check on OtterSpace here](https://radicle.community/t/temperature-check-use-otterspace-non-transferable-tokens-for-distribution-of-influence-mechanism/3055).

## Overview

### Voting Types

There are 2 types of votes:
1. Badge Votes: this includes Radicle Grants Org Team Members - who hold a _Team Member Badge_ - and Grantees - who hold a _Grantee Badge_. Both badge types confer the same voting power: 1 badge, 1 vote. These are used for off-chain voting to collect broad input from all badge holders within the Grants community.
2. Multi-Sig Votes: this includes Radicle Grants Org Team Members. These votes are meant to finalize on-chain decisions, which generally means sending funds to Grantees. In general, we will aim to match our votes to upstream Badge Votes, but may use our votes as a final check or veto.

### Voting Stages

There are 2 stages to voting on proposals, in order:
1. Badge Vote: anyone who holds a Radicle Grants Badge may vote on off-chain proposals via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/radiclegrants.eth).
2. Multi-Sig Vote: final on-chain votes that approve and send funds for any proposals.

### Voting Philosophy 

The reason for introducing Badge Votes is two-fold.

#### Decentralize Voting Power 
Adding Grantees into the mix should, over time, add a large multiplier to our ability to review and decide on what is valuable to the community of builders within the Radicle ecosystem.

As a thought experiment, let's imagine that 2 years from now we've funded 100 separate Grantees, each with their own Badge Vote.  If just 5% (or 5 Badge holders) of them remain active participants in our community, this will mean essentially doubling the number of people reviewing on and providing feedback to our Grants processes. 

#### Streamline On-Chain Work
A common issue with on-chain voting is starting a vote prematurely and getting bogged down in feedback loops to reach consensus.

This has adverse impact on other votes that may be sitting in queue and - as a DAO scales - can cause unreasonable delays to downstream votes that may be totally unrelated to the upstream vote in question.

So adding this upstream step of off-chain voting will allow for us to collect strong signals before bringing up an on-chain vote. It will help lower the risk of quagmire often seen in starting on-chain votes prematurely.

# Funding

This page covers steps to execute on-chain proposals.

In the example below, we look at funding the Radicle Grants multi-sig.

## Process

1. Go to the [Radicle Governance contract here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x690e775361ad66d1c4a25d89da9fcd639f5198ed)

2. Go to `Contract` > `Write Contract` > `queue` -> Enter details 

> Example
> 
> Going on Sybil, [this proposal](https://gov.radicle.network/#/proposals/radicle/5) would be Proposal #5, so on Etherscan, we'd enter `5` for `proposalId`

3. Click `Write`

4. Wait a few days

5. Go to `Contract` > `Write Contract` > `execute` -> Enter details 

> Example
> 
> Going on Sybil, [this proposal](https://gov.radicle.network/#/proposals/radicle/5) would be Proposal #5, so on Etherscan, we'd enter `5` for `proposalId`. We would use `XXX` for `execute/payableAmount`.

6. Click `Write`

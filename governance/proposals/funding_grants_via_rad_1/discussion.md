## Purpose

The purpose of this proposal is to make an injection of XXX RAD into the [Radworks Grants Wallet](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x394B920c5d39E0Ca40fCa2871569B6B90D750c7c).

The goal of this proposal is three-fold:
1. Give grantees voting power.
2. Give grantees ownership in the protocols they build.
3. Incentivize grantees to have a longer term interest in our protocols.

## Overview & Background
> ðŸ‘‰ What is being proposed? What resources can be shared to provide additional context?

We currently fund grants exclusively using USDC.

USDC is a vital resource as it is one of the easiest on/off ramps for fiat, which is important for grantees who have bills to pay. 

USDC acts as a _good enough_ incentive for grantees to start and finish work. 

However, by not paying out in RAD, we are not giving grantees any ownership and voting power in the very protocols they are building on.

For more on the Grants Program, please [see the latest approved proposal](https://community.radworks.org/t/formal-review-rgp-14-start-the-radicle-org/3304). The Grants Program itself is a well established DAO with multiple approved proposal.

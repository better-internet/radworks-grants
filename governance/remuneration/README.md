# Remuneration

This area is meant to provide complete transparency on the Radworks Grant Program's committee remunerations.

We plan on using this process only for the first grants wave.

The plan for subsequent grant waves is to use [Drips](https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-landing-page) to make this process more automated and transparent.

## For the community

Please feel free to check this repo at any time.

If you take issue with anything in it, please do the following:
* Go to the Issues tab of this repo ([link here](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/issues))
* Click on "New issue"
* Give a descriptive name and leave detailed notes on any issue

## For committee members

At the end of each month, please do the following:
* Clone the ``radicle-grants`` repository
* Create a branch with your that follows the format ``invoice-firstName-lastName``. Pseudonymous names are fine (e.g. ``git checkout -b invoice-bordumb``)
* Duplicate the [``template.md``](template.md) file and rename similarly with the format ``month1-firstName-lastName.md`` (e.g. ``month1-bordumb.md``)
* Fill the template with detailed notes on the work done, how many hours worked per task, and the sum total for the month
* Place this file in the respective ``wave_N/month_N`` directory (e.g. ``wave_1/month_1``)
* Start a PR for review

Or if you are less technically inclined, feel free to just copy/paste the content, fill it in, and email to <bordumbb@gmail.com>. I will upload it for you.

## FAQs

*Q: Can a committee member also work on a grant? And how does payment work in this case?*

A: Yes, a committee member can apply for and work on a grant. 

However, when making their invoice for committee work, they must not include any work that is part of the grant (i.e. no double-dipping).

Also, you must abstain from the multi-sig vote for approving your application as well as any milestone/completion votes. This is to avoid obvious conflicts of interest.

*Q: What is acceptable as a line item on invoices?*

A: Almost anything within reason.

* If you have to buy a book to learn about a topic, put that down.
* If you commit PRs to this repo to improve the documentation, put the time you spent doing that down.
* If you have to test using a protocol and incur some fee (e.g. gas fees), put that down.
* If you need to spend time learning about a topic, put the time you spent studying down.
* If you scheduled a meeting with a DAO (e.g. education DAO about making content about Radicle tutorials, etc.), put the time you spent doing that down.
* If you scheduled a meeting with someone knowledgeable to learn about something used in a grant's application or milestone, put the time you spend doing that down.

The more data points (i.e. transparecy) you provide, the more the community can learn from our processes as a DAO processes. 

Please make sure to document as much of the work you do (e.g. share notes from meetings, studying, etc.) so that it's asynchronously digestible by others.

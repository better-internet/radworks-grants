# Remuneration

This area is meant to provide complete transparency on the Radicle Grant Program's committee remunerations.

We plan on using this process only for the first grants wave.

The plan for subsequent grant waves is to use [Drips](https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-landing-page) to make this process more automated and transparent.

## For committee members

At the end of each month, please do the following:
* Clone the ``radicle-grants`` repository
* Create a branch with your that follows the format ``invoice-firstName-lastName``. Pseudonymous names are fine (e.g. ``git checkout -b invoice-bordumb``)
* Duplicate the ``template.md`` file and rename similarly with the format ``month1-firstName-lastName.md`` (e.g. ``month1-bordumb.md``)
* Fill the template with detailed notes on the work done, how many hours worked per task, and the sum total for the month

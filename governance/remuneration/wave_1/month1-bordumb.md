1 hour:
* Call with DevDAO leader (Discord: tonyolendo#5739) about hackathons
* Takeaway: we could sponsor a hackathon, probably around March/April timeframe. Participants could work on anything they want, but we would have some Radicle related prerequisites. For example, all participants most onboard to and host their code on Radicle. 

30 min:
* Call with Nas to talk about strategy for working with DevDAO and other Public Goods related projects
* Takeaway: the branding around Public Goods Funding is important. We should think more about how we fit into that conversation.

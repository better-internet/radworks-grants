## Grants Org - Q1 2024 Update

## General Announcements & Updates

### Integrations and Tooling 

The Grants Org made its final grants to Yorgos and team (now the Integrations and Tooling Org).

This includes initial work on CI/CD as well as the planning board.

More details here:
https://community.radworks.org/t/radicle-developer-tooling-jan-mar-2024/3473/3 

### Entity Formation

We are in early talks to create a formal entity around the Grants Program.

This will include a legal entity as well as KYC requirements for future Grantees.

Part of this process will include returning remaining funds in the Grants multi-sig to the Foundation, then creating a new Org Proposal via the legal entity.

The aim of this is to create more rigorous processes around Grants, as well as basic compliance as we grow the program.

### Membership 

We will be removing Reverie (`0xc1d7253392f2cFBA7a41f43222062905EE2D2934`) from the multi-sig membership and committee due to inactivity on the grant reviews.

## Quarterly Objectives Updates

A significant amount of this quarter was spent getting the 2024 Grants Org Proposal approved. 

### Recruiting
Objective: 
* Onboard grantees to more permanent work within the Radicle ecosystem.

Results: 
* We worked closely with Yorgos and team to create the new Integration and Tooling Org, which is the first case of a grantee evolving into a full fledged org.

### Dogfooding
Objective:
* Switch 100% of grants over to Drips
* Switch 100% of our documents over to Radicle (code collab)

* Results:
* 100% of our grants this quarter have been funded with Drips.
* We have not switched our repository over to Radicle. 

> ðŸ‘‰ Please include a high-level budget update based off of report that will be provided by Ops before the call. (i.e. are you on/under/over budget & why?)

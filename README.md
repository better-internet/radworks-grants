## Introduction

If you're reading this, you're as interested as we are in promoting Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and the
ever growing Web3 ecosystem.

To this end, Radicle is introducing its own grants program, the Radicle Grants Program.

The aim is to directly support open source initiatives that help grow the Radicle product, the Radicle community, and
the greater FOSS and Web3 community at large.

This page will cover the basics of the Radicle Grants Program's ethos, application processes, and structure.

### Guidelines

Come one, come all!

We are open to any applications, whether you are applying to tackle an RFP we've provided or you're applying with some
ideas of your own.

In general, though, the focus is on technical projects, such as additions to core Radicle software or components of
Web3 infrastructure that interact with Radicle.

Below are high level things we look for:

- Your project has **sustainability** front and center. A project that has a plan to be **self-sustaining** and **maintained**
  for the long run will shine above others. We would love nothing more than to have a Radicle grant act as seed funding
  for projects that create value well beyond the grant's initial window.
- Your project is **open source** through and through. It ideally contributes to some core Radicle product features and
  reflects a deep empathy for others working on FOSS. This includes an understanding of the importance of documentation,
  maintainibility, extensibility, testing, and clean coding principals.
- You have **strong and relevant** experience. We're looking for pros who have a proven track record in whatever
  language, frameworks, and tooling are needed to get a project past the finish line.

Lastly, all work **must** adhere to the following criteria:

- All code produced during your grant must be **open-sourced** with proper licensing (Apache 2.0, GPLv3, MIT or
  Unlicense).
- All code must not rely on closed-sourced software or infrastructure to be fully functioning.
- We will not fund projects that support any illicit activity (gambling, money laundering, etc.).

We take licensing and proper recognition very seriously. We want to celebrate not just your work, but the work
of the giants whose shoulders we are building on. Any attempt to pass work that is not yours off as your own will be
grounds for **immediate termination** of work without pay. Please feel free to start a discussion if you are unsure on
any work.

### Project Ideas

We see project ideas coming from 2 main sources:

- [Requests For Proposals](rfps) (RFPs) will be clearly outlined projects that we would like to see implemented.
  We accept applications to tackle RFPs from multiple individuals and teams. This means you may be in competition for a
  grant. Where it makes sense, we may also award one grant across multiple teams.
- Open Applications. These will follow the same format as our internal RFPs. If you have an idea for an RFP that you
  don't see, by all means send in an application. More on this in the [process](#process) section.

No matter the source of the project idea, the entire application process will be transparent and public on Radicle.

Currently the RFPs come centrally from the core development team. The end goal is to progressively decentralize this
process such that the line between RFP and open applications is blurred and goes away over time. Open application will
be treated as a first class citizen!

### Support

The scope of Radicle Grants includes the following:

- Feedback before/during the application process
- Funding
- Feedback on delivered milestones

Outside of these 3 Fs, the grant will not provide a hands-on assistance or mentorship experience.

We are expecting individuals and teams who are planning to own the work from start to finish.

If you have specific issues during development, for example understanding a certain implementation in the Radicle source
code, the core development team is available to answer questions via [Discord](https://discord.gg/cS42wyG7) or [Matrix](https://matrix.radicle.community/).

### Team

#### Radicle Grants Committee

This group will act as signers of the Radicle Grant Program's multi-sig, which will ultimately fund projects.

The Radicle Grants Committee is made up of core Radicle team members, Radicle community members, and outside folks who
have some sort of related domain expertise.

## Process

As noted, we expect applications to be based on existing RFPs or an open application.

The entire process includes these 3 steps:

#### 1. [Application & Review](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants/applications)

#### 2. [Milestone Delivery](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/hyperlinkFixes/grants/milestone_deliveries) & [Milestone Evaluation](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/hyperlinkFixes/grants/milestone_evaluations)

#### 3. [Payment](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants#payment)

## Levels

The Radicle Grants Program offers different grant levels to help you best depending on your current stage.

If you have a question about which level to apply to, please reach out on the Grant's #ðŸ’¬general category on [Discord](https://discord.gg/aNZdn5hP).

### ðŸŒ± Seed Grants (Level 1)

Seed grants are meant for smaller projects, both in terms of complexity and cost.

* **Target:** Individuals & small teams
* **Amount:** less than $50,000

### ðŸŒ² Tree Grants (Level 2)

Seed grants are meant for larger projects in terms of scope, complexity, and time to completion.

* **Target:** teams, companies, or foundations with a proven record
* **Amount:** more than $50,000 (up to $500,000)

## Alt Funding Sources

In lieu of a grant, you may find info below helpful to fund any projects you have in mind.

### Hackathons

Radicle may organise, sponser, or in some capacity of another participate in hackathons.

These can be a great avenue for funding.

Below is a list of hackathons Radicle has sponsored in the past:

- [ETHGlobal](https://online.ethglobal.com/)
- [Ceramic - Sovereign Data Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/ceramic-identity/onboard)

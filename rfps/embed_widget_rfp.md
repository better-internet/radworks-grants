## Project Description :page_facing_up:

Embeddable widget that allows any creator to bring crypto-based subscriptions/membership to their website using Radicle.

Similar to front-end widgets implemented below:
* [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/en-gb/payments/elements)
* [Shopify Widgets](https://taggbox.com/support/how-to-embed-widget-on-shopify-website/)

The vision for this product is **BIG**.

We could see it being used by any sort of creator, including but not limited to:
* Writers and Publishers (e.g. substack like subscriptions)
* Video makers (e.g. a "YouTube" for web3)
* Music services (e.g. a "Spotify" for web3)
* What else can you think of?

The main goal here is to abstract [Radicle Drips](https://docs.drips.network/docs/whats-a-drip.html) such that it is integrated with anything online worth paying for. In essence, make it accessible to non-technical people.

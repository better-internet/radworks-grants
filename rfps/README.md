# Requests For Proposals (RFPs)

This area is for organizing RFPs.

RFPs are meant to outline future work that there is demand for.

RFPs may be created by the core development team - say to list out tasks they want help with - or can be community driven.

If you would like any addition to the ecosystem, please do the following:

- Clone the `radicle-grants` repository
- Create a branch with the name of your RFP (e.g. `git checkout -b rfp-myModule`)
- Duplicate the `template.md` file and rename it to reflect your RFP's content (e.g. `myModule.md`)
- Start a PR for review

Or if you are less technically inclined, feel free to just copy/paste the content, fill it in, and email to <bordumbb@gmail.com>.

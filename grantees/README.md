# Grants Process

## Application

If you have a contribution that is not technical in nature, please feel free to apply via [our non-technical application here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpzrxNQIOGKT2sfr5zkQysCa_v1RPZt4oVO6zCuPKX-GIUEw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Otherwise, please follow the steps below for technical applications.

1.  [Fork](https://github.com/radicle/grants-program/fork) this repository.
2.  In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template
    ([`applications/template.md`](template.md)).
3.  Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
4.  Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more technically detailed, the less back-and-forth
    we'll have, and the faster we can make a decision.
5.  You will see a comment template that contains a checklist. You can leave it as is and tick the checkboxes once the pull request has been created. Please read through these items and check all of them.
6.  Sign off on the [terms and conditions](docs/T&Cs.md) <!--- TODO -->

## Application Review

1.  The [committee](#radicle-grants-committee) will review, add comments where needed, and possibly make change
    requests on your application PR.
2.  Clarifications and amendments should be made in a timely manner. If you don't respond within 2 weeks, we may close the application due to inactivity. You're welcome reopen an application from the same work, assuming it was not rejected.
3.  When all requested changes are addressed and the terms and conditions have been signed, someone will mark your application as `ready for review` and share it internally with the rest of the committee.
4.  The application will be accepted and merged as soon as it receives the required number of approvals (see [levels](#level_slider-levels)), or closed after two weeks of inactivity. Unless specified otherwise, the day on which it is accepted will be considered the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.

## Milestone Delivery

1.  Milestones are to be delivered on the [Grant Milestone Delivery](https://github.com/Radicle/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/) repository following the [process](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/blob/main/docs/deliverables_guideline.md#mailbox-milestone-delivery-process) described therein.

## Payment

1.  For the first wave of grants, once your application is approved, you will receive 40% of the grant to start. Upon final completion, the remaining 60% will be dispersed. If your grant includes multiple deliverables, we will split this payment out per deliverable.

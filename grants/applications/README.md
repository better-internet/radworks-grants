## :mailbox: Application Process

:warning: Before you submit an application, make sure it complies with our [Guidelines](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#guidelines).

If you have a contribution that is not technical in nature, please feel free to apply via [our non-technical application here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpzrxNQIOGKT2sfr5zkQysCa_v1RPZt4oVO6zCuPKX-GIUEw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Otherwise, please follow the steps below for technical applications:
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/fork) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template 
      ([`applications/template.md`](applications/template.md)). 
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md` and place it in the respective grant wave directory (e.g. `wave_1/project_name.md`)
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more technically detailed, the less back-and-forth 
      we'll have, and the faster we can make a decision.
   5. You will see a comment template that contains a checklist. You can leave it as is and tick the checkboxes once the pull request has been created. Please read through these items and check all of them.
   6. Sign off on the [terms and conditions](docs/T&Cs.md)  <!--- TODO -->

Applications will be reviewed via the PR. Clarifications and amendments should be made in a timely manner. If you don't respond within 2 weeks, we may close the application due to inactivity. You're welcome reopen an application from the same work, assuming it was not rejected.

Once approved and merged, the application is "successful" and formal multi-sig vote + payment will be made ASAP.

## :mailbox: Application Process

:warning: Before you submit an application, make sure it complies with our [Guidelines](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#guidelines).

## ðŸŒ± Seed Grants
If you have a contribution that falls within [level 1-2](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#levels) or is not technical in nature, please fill out the form below:

### [Seed Grant Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7TVIJmxoNnFQPWodD6LPVfdKoh8fcgbnFeXsWidBUO7K2nA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## ðŸŒ² Tree Grants
Otherwise, for larger ([levels 2-3](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#levels)) and more technically involved grants, please follow the steps below for technical applications:
   1. Copy/paste the markdown file ([`applications/template.md`](template.md)). 
   2. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more technically detailed, the less back-and-forth 
      we'll have, and the faster we can make a decision. 
   3. Make a post on [Radicle's Discourse in the Grants category](https://radicle.community/)

The committee and community members may ask questons there.

Clarifications and amendments should be made in a timely manner. If you don't respond within 2 weeks, we may close the application due to inactivity. You're welcome to reopen an application from the same work, assuming it was not rejected.

Once approved, the application is "successful" and formal multi-sig vote + payment will be made ASAP. See [Payment](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants#payment) for more details.

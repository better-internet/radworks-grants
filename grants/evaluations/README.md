# Radicle Grant Milestone Evaluations <!-- omit in toc -->

> **:loudspeaker:** This section is only for submitting evaluations of finished milestones for the [Radicle Foundation Grants Program](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants).

## :ballot_box_with_check: External Evaluations

As part of the grant program, we allow everyone to participate in the evaluation process of submitted milestones. Successfully merged external evaluations will receive **up to 1000 USDC**, depending on the quality and depth of the evaluation. The payout will be sent to their desired wallet address.

### Requirements

- GitHub account.
- The evaluation must be submitted within 10 days after the milestone was delivered.

### Process

1. [Fork](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants) this repository.
2. In the newly created fork, create a **copy** of the evaluation template ([`evaluations/evaluation-template.md`](evaluations/evaluation_template.md)).
3. Name the file `project-name_milestone-number_your-github-username.md`.
4. Fill out the template with the specifics of your evaluation. The higher the quality of your assessment and the level of detail, the higher the USDC recompense.
5. Once you have completed the evaluation, create a pull request.
6. Add a comment or review to the pull request that contains the evaluated milestone delivery. This comment should contain a quick summary of your finding as well as link to the milestone submission.
7. Milestone evaluations are double-checked by [Radicle Grants Evaluators](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#team). Successful milestone evaluations are merged and the evaluator is rewarded with USDC.

*You can evaluate as many deliveries as you like. With each successful evaluation, the probability of being double-checked decreases and eventually you'll be added to the list of [Radicle Grants Evaluators](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#team) yourself.*

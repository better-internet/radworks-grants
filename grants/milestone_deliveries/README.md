## :mailbox: Milestone Delivery Process

The milestone delivery process is part of the [Radworks Grants Program](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants). You can find the application process [here](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants).  

:warning: Before you submit a milestone, make sure it complies with our [Guidelines for Milestone Deliverables](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/blob/main/docs/deliverables_guideline.md).

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/fork) this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the application.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md`](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/blob/main/grants/milestone_deliveries/delivery_template.md)). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/blob/main/grants/milestone_deliveries/delivery_template.md) of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the file `project_name-milestone_number.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request with these changes.
2. **Milestone Review:**
   1. [Evaluators](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#team) can (and usually do) issue comments and request changes on the pull request. Their feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
   2. Grants Evaluators will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
3. **Milestone Payment:**
   1. The [operations team](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#team) receives a notification once the delivery is accepted. Payments are usually processed within 14 days. See more [here](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants#payment).
   2. Payment is made to the Ethereum address specified in the initial application. Payments are made in USDC.

Grant applications can be [amended](https://github.com/Radicle/Grants-Program#changes-to-a-grant-after-approval) at any time. However, this _necessitates a reevaluation by the committee_. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.

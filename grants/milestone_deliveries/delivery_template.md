# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

> âš¡ Only the GitHub account that submitted the application is allowed to submit milestones. 
> 
> Don't remove any of the mandatory parts presented in bold letters or as headlines! Lines starting with `>`, such as this one, can be removed.

**The [invoice form :pencil:](TODO) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/blob/main/docs/deliverables_guideline.md).**  

* **Application Document:** Please, provide a link to the merged contract (the `.md` file in the [applications](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grantees/applications) directory).
* **Milestone Number:** e.g. 1

**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | ... |...| ...| 
| 2.  | ... |...| ...| 

**Additional Information**
> Any further comments on the milestone that you would like to share with us.

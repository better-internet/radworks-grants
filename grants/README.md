# Grants Process

## Applications

We accept both technical (codebase contributions, 3rd party integrations, etc.) and non-technical (hackathons, videos, blogs, tutorials, etc.).

#### 1. Freeform Grant 
* Apply for any work you think deserves funding, whether it's a contribution to Radicle, FOSS, or web3 
* Copy and fill out our handy [markdown template here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/main/grants/applications/template.md)
* Create a new post in the [grants category](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24) of [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/).

#### 2. Request for Proposal (RFP) Grant
* Apply towards an existing proposal, most likely posted by us on [Discourse forum](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24).
* If we've posted an RFP, just drop a reply on Discourse with some details on why you'd be a good fit. You can see some of the [details we're looking for here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/main/grants/applications/template.md).

If you don't want to work on a grant, but have an idea, feel free to create an [RFP using our template](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/blob/main/rfps/template.md) and post it on the [grants category](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24) of [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/).

## Application Review

1.  The [committee](#radicle-grants-committee) will review, add comments where needed, and possibly make change
    requests on your application. Unless further discussion is warranted, we will approve or reject applications within 2 weeks.
2.  Clarifications and amendments should be made in a timely manner. If you don't respond within 2 weeks, we may close the application due to inactivity. You're welcome reopen an application from the same work, assuming it was not rejected.
3.  When all requested changes are addressed, someone will mark your application as `ready for review` and share it internally with the rest of the committee.
4.  The application will be accepted and added to this repo, or closed after two weeks of inactivity. Unless specified otherwise, the day on which it is accepted will be considered the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.

## Milestone Delivery

Milestones are to be delivered through the [deliveries](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants/milestone_deliveries) directory following the process described therein.

## Payment

Payment is made in [USDC](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48).

For the first wave of grants, once your application is approved, you will receive 20% of the grant to start. Upon final completion, the remaining 80% will be dispersed. 

If your grant includes multiple deliverables, we will split this payment out per deliverable. 

For example, let's say your grant has 2 major components/deliverables, totalling 10,000 USDC: 
* Deliverable A takes 1 month and you want 2,000 UDSC
* Deliverable B takes 2 months and you want 8,000 UDSC

Both may be approved to start on the same date, at which point you will receive 2,000 USDC (20% of Deliverable A + 20% of Deliverable B). At the end of month 1, once Deliverable A is completed, you will get the remaining 80% of that (1,600 USDC). And once Deliverable B is completed, you will get the remaining 80% of that (6,400 USDC). So the total will be the original 10,000 USDC you requested.

## FAQs

*Q: Does the Radicle Grant Program assist with taxes involved in payments?*

A: No. Any tax or other compliance is the responsibility of the grantee.

*Q: How are payments handled if a grant project's work is late?*

A: There will be a grace period of 2 months after the grants program's 6 month term is ended. After this, all grant program funds are returned to the Radicle Treasury. If work is last beyond this, the grantee will need to wait until the next grant's wave for payment, assuming they finish the work. 

*Q: Can I apply if I am working on a project that is not directly related to Radicle. It is more to do with the broader open source or web 3 ecosystem.*

A: Yes, absolutely. We are interested in fund any work that gets more people involved with open source work and web3, whether it be through some tech tooling or education.

# Grants Process

## Applications

We accept both technical (codebase contributions, 3rd party integrations, etc.) and non-technical (hackathons, videos, blogs, tutorials, etc.).

Depending on which you are applying for, please use these application steps:
* Technical: please follow the steps in the [applications section](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants/applications)
* Non-technical: please fill out [our non-technical application here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpzrxNQIOGKT2sfr5zkQysCa_v1RPZt4oVO6zCuPKX-GIUEw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Application Review

1.  The [committee](#radicle-grants-committee) will review, add comments where needed, and possibly make change
    requests on your application PR.
2.  Clarifications and amendments should be made in a timely manner. If you don't respond within 2 weeks, we may close the application due to inactivity. You're welcome reopen an application from the same work, assuming it was not rejected.
3.  When all requested changes are addressed and the terms and conditions have been signed, someone will mark your application as `ready for review` and share it internally with the rest of the committee.
4.  The application will be accepted and merged as soon as it receives the required number of approvals (see [levels](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#levels)), or closed after two weeks of inactivity. Unless specified otherwise, the day on which it is accepted will be considered the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.

## Milestone Delivery

Milestones are to be delivered through the [deliveries](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/grants/milestone_deliveries) directory following the process described therein.

## Payment

For the first wave of grants, once your application is approved, you will receive 40% of the grant to start. Upon final completion, the remaining 60% will be dispersed. 

If your grant includes multiple deliverables, we will split this payment out per deliverable. 

For example, let's say your grant has 2 major components/deliverables, totalling 15,000 USDC: 
* Deliverable A takes 1 month and you want 5,000 UDSC
* Deliverable B takes 2 months and you want 10,000 UDSC

Both may be approved to start on the same date, at which point you will receive 6,000 USDC (40% of Deliverable A + 40% of Deliverable B). At the end of month 1, once Deliverable A is completed, you will get the remaining 60% of that (3,000 USDC). And once Deliverable B is completed, you will get the remaining 60% of that (6,000 USDC). So the total will be the original 15,000 USDC you requested.

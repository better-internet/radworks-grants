# Funding Open Source to Empower Open Source

> Radicle is software that empowers collaboration on and funding of open source work. The Grants Program is a first step towards many things. (a) Open sourcing the development of Radicle itself (b) sustainability funding the growth of the Radicle product and (c) the start of a new model for funding open source software, dog-fooded by Radicle.

## How do I apply for a grant?
There are two tracks for applying...

### ðŸŒ± Seed Grants

These are smaller (<$50,000) or more technical grants.

###[Application form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7TVIJmxoNnFQPWodD6LPVfdKoh8fcgbnFeXsWidBUO7K2nA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

The application will only be shared with members of the grants committee. Applications that pass may be saved in one of our repos.

### ðŸŒ² Tree Grants

These are larger (>$50,000) or more technical grants. 

Copy and fill out out our handy [markdown template here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/main/grants/applications/template.md).

Post that application in the [grants category of Radicle's forum](). 

## Which application is right for me?
If your project is small in scope, timeline, or is not technical in nature, a Seed Grant is probably best. It's a faster process.

If your project is large in scope, will take a while, or gets into fine technical or design details, we recommend a Tree Grant.

If you're still not sure:

Reach out to us in the Grants' #general space on Radicle's Discord. 
Or shoot me an email at <bordumbb@gmail.com>.

## What happens after I apply?

Your application will be reviewed by the [Grants Committee](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#team).

The committee will vote, using a multi-sig.

Once approved, you will get your first payment to help you get started with work.

## Where can I find more info?

The most up-to-date info can be found on the Grant Program's [Radicle Upstream Repo]() or [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants).

## It's that easy!?
Yup, that's it. 

If you have the ability to make Radicle's ecosystem better, we will fund you.

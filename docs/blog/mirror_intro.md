# Funding Open Source to Empower Open Source ðŸŒ±

Today we are launching Radicle's first wave of grants.

With six months and a $1,000,000 budget, the Radicle Grants Program will be funding contributions that improve the Radicle ecosystem, and in turn, improve tooling for open source collaboration.

We are breaking ground to plant the first seeds of what is sure to grow into a new model for funding open source.

In essence: funding open source to empower open source.

## How do I apply for a grant?
There are two tracks for applying...

### ðŸŒ± Seed Grants

These are smaller (<$50,000) or less technical grants.

### [Application form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7TVIJmxoNnFQPWodD6LPVfdKoh8fcgbnFeXsWidBUO7K2nA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

The application will only be shared with members of the grants committee. Applications that pass may be saved in one of our repos.

### ðŸŒ² Tree Grants

These are larger (>$50,000) or more technical grants. 

Copy and fill out our handy [markdown template here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/main/grants/applications/template.md).

Post that application in the [grants category of Radicle's forum](). 

## Which application is right for me?
If your project is small in scope, timeline, or is not technical in nature, a Seed Grant is probably best. It's a faster process.

If your project is large in scope, will take a while, or gets into fine technical or design details, we recommend a Tree Grant.

## What happens after I apply?

Your application will be reviewed by the [Grants Committee](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#team).

The committee will vote, using a multi-sig.

Once approved, you will get your first payment to help you get started with work.

## Where can I find more info?

The most up-to-date info can be found on the Grant Program's [Radicle Upstream Repo]() or [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants).

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on the Grant's #general space on [Radicle's Discord](https://discord.gg/aNZdn5hP).
Or shoot me an email at <bordumbb@gmail.com>.

## It's that easy!?
Yup, that's it. 

If you have the ability to make Radicle's ecosystem better, we will fund you.

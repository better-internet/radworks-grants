# Radworks Grants: Funding Open Source to Grow Open Source ðŸŒ±

On Monday, January 10, the Radworks community voted to fund the first wave of the Radworks Grants Program. With six months and a $1M budget, the Radworks Grants Program will fund contributions that improve the Radworks ecosystem, and in turn, improve tooling for decentralized, open-source collaboration.

With these Treasury-funded community grants, we believe we are planting the first seeds of will grow to become a new model for funding open source. The aim is to directly support open source initiatives that help grow the Radicle product, the Radworks community, and the greater FOSS and Web3 community at large.

In essence: funding open source to grow open source.

The Grants program will be managed by a committee made up of Radworks community members:

- *Grants Lead:* [Bordumb](https://twitter.com/bordumbb) (Radicle Community)
- [Abbey Titcomb](https://twitter.com/abbey_titcomb) (Core Team)
- [Kei Kreutler](https://twitter.com/keikreutler) (Ecosystem)
- [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) (Ecosystem)
- [Nassar Hayat](https://twitter.com/nassarhayat) (Core Team)
- [Reverie](https://twitter.com/hi_reverie) (comprised of [Derek Hsue](https://twitter.com/derek_hsue) and [Larry Sukernik](https://twitter.com/lsukernik) from the Radicle Community)

This group will act as signers of the [Radworks Grant Program's multi-sig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x394B920c5d39E0Ca40fCa2871569B6B90D750c7c/balances), which will ultimately fund projects. All Radworks Grants operations & budgets will be publicly managed and hosted on Radicle via the [grants.radicle.eth](https://app.radicle.network/orgs/grants.radicle.eth) org. The repositories are also [mirrored on GitHub](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants).

## How do I apply for a grant?

There are 2 ways to apply:

#### 1. Freeform Grant 
* Apply for any work you think deserves funding, whether it's a contribution to Radicle, FOSS, or web3 
* Copy and fill out our handy [markdown template here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/main/grants/applications/template.md)
* Create a new post in the [grants category](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24) of [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/).

#### 2. Request for Proposal (RFP) Grant
* Apply towards an existing proposal, most likely posted by us on [Discourse forum](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24).
* If we've posted an RFP, just drop a reply on Discourse with some details on why you'd be a good fit. You can see some of the [details we're looking for here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/main/grants/applications/template.md).

If you don't want to work on a grant, but have an idea, feel free to create an [RFP using our template](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/blob/main/rfps/template.md) and post it on the [grants category](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24) of [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/).

## What is the scope of these grants?

We are open to anything that improves the Radworks ecosystem or the greater FOSS and Web3 community at large.

Generally speaking, we have two categories of grants:

### ðŸŒ± Seed Grants

Seed grants are meant for smaller contributions, both in terms of complexity and cost. These grants are for individuals or small teams looking for less than $50,000 in funding. 

Applications for seed grants are reviewed by the grants committee on a rolling basis. If accepted, applications are then published publicly in our repositories. 

### ðŸŒ² Tree Grants

Tree grants are meant for larger teams, companies, or foundations working on a contribution larger in scope and complexity. They can provide funding from $50,000 - $500,000. 

### Which application is right for me?
ðŸŒ± If your project is smaller in scope, has a shorter timeline, and/or can be clearly defined by a set of deliverables, a Seed Grant is probably best. It's a faster process.

ðŸŒ² If your project is larger in scope & timeline, features more complex technical work, and/or requires longer-term collaboration, we recommend a Tree Grant. Tree Grants are also best fit for partnership proposals.

### What happens after I apply?

For Seed Grants, you application will be reviewed by the [Grants Committee](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#team) on a rolling basis. You should receive a response within a week. 

For Tree Grants, once your application is published via [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24), the application will remain open for public discussion. Unless further discussion is warranted, you should receive a response within 2 weeks.

The committee will vote to approve funding.

Once approved, you will get your first payment (20%) to help you get started with work.

Upon completion, you will receive the remaining 80%.

### 1. DAO Partnerships

**3rd Party Tooling/Integrations**
* **IDE Plugins**: [user research milestone](https://radicle.community/t/application-radicle-ide-plugins-ux-design/2728/28) for Visual Studio Code IDE Plug-In @yorgos

  * TODO:
    * Create Radicle-wide user personas/stories

**Badges + Distribution of Influence**
* [We funded OtterSpace's grant](https://radicle.community/t/otterspace-soulbound-contributor-badges-for-daos-grant-application/2868/8) to create soul-bound (i.e. non-transferrable NFTs).
* TODO:
  * Create grant for badge design templates, such that badges can be easily spun up with aligned branding.
  * Create 1 badge for RGP committee members.
  * Create 1 badge for grantees, which will be sent upon grant approval.

* TODOs:
  * Setup 100% of those dependencies up for Drips. 
  * Drip $10,000 ($40,000 in total, or ~4% of budget) to each dependency.

**Retroactive Funding**

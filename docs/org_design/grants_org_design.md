## **Purpose**

The _Radicle Grants Org_'s goal is:

> To find, fund, and guide research and development of any projects that fall outside the purview of the [Drips Org](https://radicle.community/t/discussion-drips-org-proposal-2023/3289) and [Radicle Org](https://radicle.community/t/discussion-radicle-org-proposal-2023/3288).

Past projects include things like: 
* [Development of JetBrains IDE Plugin](https://radicle.community/t/radicle-jetbrains-ide-plugin-0-5-x/3221)
* [Development of VS Code IDE Plugin](https://radicle.community/t/application-radicle-vs-code-extension-implementation-phase-1/3099)
* [OtterSpace badges for scaling governance](https://radicle.community/t/otterspace-soulbound-contributor-badges-for-daos-grant-application/2868)
* [Research into binary storage](https://radicle.community/t/grant-application-package-manager/3122/11)

More broadly, the _Radicle Grants Org_ is open to funding the following grant categories:

## Annual Strategy & Quarterly Objectives

### Recruiting

**Goal:** Onboard grantees to more permanent work within the Radicle ecosystem.

**Philosophy:** The aim with this is to provide a model for other DAOs on how to uplevel casual contributors into more permanent or regular work.

**KPIs:**
* Easy: bring 1 grantee team to the level that they can either spin off their own Org or join an existing one in a more permanent working engagement.
* Hard: bring 2+ grantee teams to that level.

**Reasoning & Analysis:**
* **How?:** we will make a point about not keeping grantees tethered or beholden to Grant funding, but instead - where it makes sense - encourage them to work directly with the main RadicleDAO, other sub-DAOs, or spin off their own sub-DAO through a new proposal.
* **Contribution to growth:** in cases where a grantee is working on an important enough problem, bringing them into the fold of more permanent work will mean putting resources behind solving important problems for the RadicleDAO at large, as well as their entire Radicle ecosystem.

### Dogfooding

**Goal:** Utilize Radicle products for both (a) the payment of grants via Drips and (b) the organization of work via CodeCollab. 

**Philosophy:** The aim with this is to create a positive feedback loop on product development, as well as to provide a model for other DAOs who may look to us for successful use cases of our products.

**KPIs:**
* Easy: run 100% of Grants payouts via Drips V2
* Hard: incentivize 100% of Grantees to use Radicle CodeCollab for their work.

**Reasoning & Analysis:**
* **How?:** the Grant Committee will allocate extra time to using tools like Drips and create an incentive structure around adoption for Grantees (e.g. give 5% bonus per grant that adopts CodeCollab).
* **Contribution to growth:** the benefits will be two-fold: create a feedback loop for product improvements and increase adoption via grantees.

### Drip to Dependencies 

**Goal:** Drip to the _Radicle Grants Org_'s dependencies.

**Philosophy:** We should exemplify what Radicle is all about: funding FOSS and Web3 projects, starting with those we depend on for Grants.

**KPIs:**
* Easy: allocate 4% (40,000 USDC) of budget to Drips balance + drip to 4 dependencies [as outlined here](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/issues/60).
* Hard: onboard all teams behind the 4 dependencies to at least 5 of their own dependencies, such that they split the incoming Drips from us further down the line. The aim being to kick off some network effects via Drips. This totals to at least 20 teams onboarded.

**Reasoning & Analysis:**
* **How?:** we will do this by reaching out to our dependencies, collecting a list of their dependencies, reaching out to those dependencies, and so on, then onboard all of these groups to Drips. Once this is completed, we will start Dripping the allocated funds.
* **Contribution to growth:** the benefits will be two-fold: (a) create successful case studies, which will help with marketing and (b) increase adoption and network effects for Drips.

## **Reporting & Success Criteria**

The _Radicle Grants Org_ will publicly share the following on [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/):
* Quarterly reports that breakdown the operations, research, and development progress made by the _Radicle Grants Org_ itself and grantees.
* An annual report that summarizes the previous 4 quarters, with any major updates to the organization and management of the _Radicle Grants Org_.

> Note: we will aim to progressively move more and more goals on-chain, such that there is a regular, transparent note of any progress made by the _Radicle Grants Org_.

## Organizational Structure

### Contributors

![image|690x388](upload://yq1KKaxpbkLBZcku0CsyYkkEaFS.png)

Within the _Radicle Grants Org_, a contributor includes:
* Committee Members (i.e. multi-sig members)
* Grantees

> Note: see more about how voting works across these 2 groups using [OtterSpace badges](https://radicle.community/t/otterspace-soulbound-contributor-badges-for-daos-grant-application/2868) in the **üèõÔ∏è Governance/Voting** section below.

#### Current Committee Members include: 
* Bordumb (_Radicle Grants Org_ Lead)
* Abbey ([Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/))
* Nas ([Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/); [DevDAO](https://www.developerdao.com/))
* Nader ([Lens Protocol](https://www.lens.xyz/))
* Derek and Larry ([Reverie](https://www.reverie.ooo/))

Responsibilities: 
* **Reviewing Applications**: reviewing applications in detail. If a committee member does not understand something, they are expected to be resourceful in learning or finding outside council on a topic.  
* **Reviewing Milestones/Completions**: reviewing milestones/completed work in detail. If a committee member does not know something, they are expected to be resourceful in learning or finding outside council on a topic. 
* **Multi-Sig voting**: participate in voting on and funding grants.
* **Meetings**: most work will be done asynchronously, but committee members are expected to actively participate on Discourse, community, and governance calls.

### üèõÔ∏è Governance/Voting

![image|690x388](upload://k2NN6NATdx3vEGFN477RTacBzuv.png)

There are 2 types of votes:
* Governance (OtterSpace): Committee Members + Grantees
* Grant Work (Gnosis Safe): Committee Members only

For more information - including how to onboard your own DAO to OtterSpace - [please see our docs here](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants/tree/main/governance/voting).

More on how these voting types maps to our contributors below.

## Communication

The most up-to-date information on the management of the _Radicle Grants Org_ can be found in [our repo here](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants).

For miscellaneous questions and comments, anyone can reach out on our [Discord here in **Grants - üí¨# general**](https://discord.gg/2mN3fys8vZ).

Grant applications and the review of grants is entirely public and carried out on the [Grants Discourse page here](https://radicle.community/c/grants/24).


## Timeline & Budget

As noted in the latest approved proposal for the [Radicle Grants Program here](https://radicle.community/t/formal-review-radicle-grants-program-continuation/3075), the _Radicle Grants Org_ shall run with optimistic funding.

We originally allocated the following amounts:

| Component:     | Budget         |
|----------------|----------------|
| Grant Funding  | 1,000,000 USDC |
| Committee Fees | 44,108 RAD     |

Regarding _Grant Funding_:
* There is no set timeline on using the funds up as this is entirely contingent on receiving grant applications and how large those grants are.
* In the roughly 1-year since the Grants Program started, ~752,000 USDC remain, meaning we have used roughly 250,000 or 25% of the budget in 1 year.

Regarding _Committee Fees_:
* _Committee Fees_ are 150 USDC per hour, meaning these are contingent on the workload of committee members. So there is no set timeline to use up the funds.
* In the roughly 1-year since the Grants Program started, ~28,000 RAD remain, meaning we have used roughly 16,000 or 36% of the budget in 1 year.

## Fund Management

As noted in the latest approved proposal for the [Radicle Grants Program here](https://radicle.community/t/formal-review-radicle-grants-program-continuation/3075), the _Radicle Grants Org_ shall run with optimistic funding.

### Topping Up Funds 

Funds - whether USDC or RAD - will be topped up through additional Org proposals.

In the event that quorum cannot be met, the current Org shall be considered disbanded. In this case, a new Grants Lead may step forward, recruit committee members, and go through the Org proposal process. 

### Fund Retrieval 

Funds can be retrieved via the following methods:
* A vote of no confidence by RAD token holders, meaning the larger ecosystem of RAD token holders.
* A vote of no confidence by OtterSpace badge holders, meaning the tighter knit community of Grants Org contributors.

Upon a vote of no confidence, the Grants Committee must rubber stamp a return of all funds back to the RadicleDAO's wallet.

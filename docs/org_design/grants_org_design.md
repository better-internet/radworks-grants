# Grants Org Design Proposal

## Introduction

This page outlines the Grants Org design.

The Grants Program has since its inception been a bit of an outlier in that it was never part of the Foundation to begin with; it was the first sub-DAO spun off.

With that said, this page aims to outline a few changes that keep the Grants Program aligned with the rest of the greater Radicle DAO and its developing sub-DAOs. 

> Note: for more on that, please reference [the larger discussion here](https://radicle.community/t/the-next-phase-of-the-radicledao/2776).

This page will answer the following questions:
* Mission: what is the Radicle Grants Program (_RGP Org_) focused on?
* Funding/Continuity: how will the _RGP Org_ be funded going forward?
* Contributors: who makes up the _RGP Org_ and who counts as a "contributor"?
* Governance/Voting: how are decisions made?

## 🎯 Mission

The _RGP Org_'s goal is simple:

> To find, fund, and guide research and development of any projects that fall outside the purview of the Core Development Org.

Past projects include things like: 
* [Development of JetBrains IDE Plugin](https://radicle.community/t/radicle-jetbrains-ide-plugin-0-5-x/3221)
* [Development of VS Code IDE Plugin](https://radicle.community/t/application-radicle-vs-code-extension-implementation-phase-1/3099)
* [OtterSpace badges for scaling governance](https://radicle.community/t/otterspace-soulbound-contributor-badges-for-daos-grant-application/2868)
* [Research into binary storage](https://radicle.community/t/grant-application-package-manager/3122/11)

More broadly, the _RGP Org_ is open to funding the following grant categories:

## 💰 Funding & Continuity

Nothing with funding is changing with the _RGP Org_'s design. This includes compensation for Committee Members, as outlined in [the original Grants Program Proposal in 2021](https://radicle.community/t/formal-review-radicle-grants-program-v2/2582#compensation-7).

If/when funds should run out, a new Org proposal will be made.

> Note: ideally, the Grant Committee will put forth a proposal well in advance of funds running out.

In the event that the next proposal is unsuccessful for any reason, the current _RGP Org_ will be considered disbanded and anyone else is welcome to create a new proposal and team.

## 👥 Contributors

Within the _RGP Org_, a contributor is anyone who contributes _and_ holds voting power within the Org.

Since the Grants Program's inception, Committee Members have been the only group with voting power.

However, with the funding and testing of [OtterSpace badges](https://radicle.community/t/otterspace-soulbound-contributor-badges-for-daos-grant-application/2868), we are adding grantees as voting members.

More on how voting works across these 2 groups below.

## 🏛️ Governance/Voting

Continuing from the last section on **Contributors**, this section outlines how each badge holding group can vote.

There are 2 types of votes:
* Governance (OtterSpace): Committee Members + Grantees
* Grant Work (Gnosis Safe): Committee Members only
